        Hi, I thought I'd make a bit of a document log for MapGame, because due to the complex nature of the project, there will inevitably be far more struggles than results.

        May 7, I'm still trying to figure out mesh intersections (as a way to divide up continents for countries) and today I'm one step closer. I've discovered a nice C++ library everyone seems to use (https://www.cgal.org/) and a nice C# wrapper (https://forum.unity.com/threads/cgaldotnet-a-c-computational-library-built-around-cgal.1250314/)
    </p>

        Nonetheless I will keep investigating further, as it only ever seems the more I expect the find the solution, the further it escapes from me.
