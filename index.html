        Ah yes, C Hashtag. Over here we have the Unity game I was working on between 2018 and 2021. 
        
        It was meant as a Colonial to Industrial age economic simulator. 
      
        I never really thought of a way of making it fun besides making it basically a clicker game,
  
      
        So it sits here as a testament to my map-painting fanatacism.
