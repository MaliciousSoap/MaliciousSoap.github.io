            Here is the repl.it program I wrote for Deloitte's Forage virtual internship coding challenge. I'm sure it took me way longer than industry professionals but it made me realize that the little coding projects and games I've worked on hold no candle to the industry standards. If I am to call myself a software developer, I need to make sure I enrich myself with what else the world has to offer.

          Ah yes, C Hashtag. Over here we have the Unity game I was working on between 2018 and 2021. 
          
          It was meant as a Colonial to Industrial age economic simulator. Eventually I got bored of dealing with 2d vector graphics and moved on, but wouldn't it have been exciting to be able to turn a colonial oppresor like Spain into a truly kind empire? Wouldn't it have been fun to play as the Zulu nation and taken a stand against imperialism? Or maybe navigating a young post-colonial nation to prosperity?
    
        
          So it sits here as a testament to my map-painting fanatacism.
