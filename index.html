            Here is the repl.it program I wrote for Deloitte's Forage virtual internship coding challenge. I'm sure it took me way longer than industry professionals, but it was my first acquaintance with a cloud based IDE, and it was exceedingly fun to complete.

        I was originally bored playing games like Europa Universalis IV, Civilization 6, and whatnot. Thinking I could make something on par while I wait for more updates, I began with this. I'm sure I could definetly make something out of this, but after a year you get burnt out. Furthermore, I found more interesting things to develop.
